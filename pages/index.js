                            <p>
                                CEO and Creative Designer Jannik Olander was
                                born in the small country of Denmark. Though
                                raised on the Danish countryside, he was
                                fascinated with style, energy, and the arts from
                                a young age. Through endeavors in the fashion
                                industry he was able to refine a distinct style
                                of beauty, quality, and spirituality. But it was
                                not until he traveled to the Far East that
                                Jannik truly gained the vision which inspired
                                him to create the first piece of Nialaya
                                Jewelry. Jannik visited a local bazaar on his
                                first trip to India. While walking through the
                                crowded market he was stopped by a local Shaman
                                who asked to read his palm. The Shaman sat
                                peacefully on a blanket made of yellow silk. The
                                once smooth fabric was weathered and red dust
                                covered parts of a once beautiful golden French
                                lily. The Shaman’s honest eyes were a calm and
                                piercing emerald green. Having felt a sincere
                                and calm energy from the man, he decided to give
                                him a few minutes of his time. He took a seat
                                next to him. “First, tell me your name”, said
                                the Shaman. They sat in silence as the Shaman
                                looked deeply into Jannik’s eyes. He then began
                                to examine his palm.
